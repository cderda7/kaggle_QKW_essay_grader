# Decisions log — v1

Every judgment call made while building this system, in the order they came up. Reference this
instead of re-litigating a choice silently in a future delta — if you want something changed,
point at the entry number.

1. **Grading engine = Claude, invoked via parallel subagents in this session, not a standalone
   script hitting an external API.** This sandbox doesn't expose a usable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to
   shell scripts. `grading/grade_essays.py` documents both real options for a headless v2 (wire up
   the Anthropic API, or keep using in-session subagent grading) in its module docstring. v1's
   actual predictions come from 10 parallel subagent calls made during this session.

2. **Rubric (`rubric_v1.md`) is a reconstructed proxy, not the verbatim official PERSUADE rubric.**
   I tried to fetch the actual rubric from the Kaggle dataset page, the competition overview page,
   and the PERSUADE 2.0 Zenodo record — none returned fetchable plain text (JS-rendered / PDF-only
   in this environment). I built the rubric from the standard analytic traits (Organization,
   Development/Elaboration, Conventions) this class of state argumentative-writing rubric is built
   from, calibrated to the score distribution observed in `personal_training_set.csv`. **This is
   the single biggest unverified assumption in the system** — if you have the real rubric document,
   share it and I'll replace this precisely.

3. **Zero-shot grading — no few-shot anchor essays pulled from `personal_training_set.csv`
   itself.** Avoids any evaluation leakage (using a training essay as a calibration example, then
   also scoring it for QWK) and keeps the full 100 essays in the eval set. Trade-off: less precise
   calibration to this dataset's specific scoring conventions than few-shot would give. Flagging
   as a natural v2 delta.

4. **Single grading pass per essay, no repeats/ensembling.** Keeps this run bounded. If you want to
   check the grader's own self-consistency (intra-rater reliability) — i.e. would it give the same
   essay the same score twice — that's a clean, cheap v2 delta (re-run the same 100 essays and QWK
   the two prediction sets against each other).

5. **Batch size = 10 essays per subagent call, 10 batches, 100/10 exactly.** Balances independence
   (smaller batches = less risk of one essay's context anchoring another) against overhead (fewer,
   larger batches = fewer calls). Each batch prompt explicitly instructs "grade each essay
   independently... do not compare essays to each other."

6. **Scope stayed to `personal_training_set.csv` only**, per your explicit instruction.
   `personal_testing_set_1.csv` (500 rows, includes score=6 examples this file doesn't have) and
   the official `train.csv`/`test.csv` were read only during initial data recon and are otherwise
   untouched — reserved for a future true-holdout validation delta.

7. **`personal_training_set.csv` is not duplicated into this folder.** All scripts read it from its
   original location so there's one source of truth on disk; only the generated
   rubric/prompts/predictions/results live under `aes_qwk_system/`.

8. **Essay text is read from disk by each grading subagent, not pasted into the orchestrator's
   prompt.** Keeps the orchestration simple and means every grading call sees the literal same CSV
   a re-run would use. Trade-off (documented in `grading/grading_prompt_template.md`): the grader
   technically has the `score` column in view in the same file, mitigated by an explicit
   "ignore/pretend it isn't there" instruction and validated post-hoc — a grader secretly reading
   the answer key would show suspiciously perfect agreement, which the results don't show (53%
   exact agreement, not ~100%).

9. **Grading subagents write their own batch result files directly (via the Write tool) rather than
   returning the full JSON in their response back to me.** Kept the main session's context light
   across 100 essays' worth of rationale text; I only see short confirmation lines plus whatever I
   choose to spot-check afterward.

10. **Confusion-matrix finding, surfaced rather than smoothed over:** the system never assigned a
    score of 1 anywhere in this run, even though 9 essays were human-rated 1 (see
    `evaluation/results_v1.md`). I'm reporting this as the main systematic disagreement pattern
    rather than treating the moderate QWK as an unexplained abstract number.

11. **Sanity-check finding on the largest single miss (`01267d1`, human=1 / system=5):** reading
    the essay directly, my working theory is that the rubric under-penalizes essays that are mostly
    strung-together quotations without original synthesis — a real gap in the proxy rubric (see
    decision #2), not a pipeline bug. Flagging as a concrete, testable candidate fix for `rubric_v2.md`
    rather than asserting it as certain — it's one data point.

12. **"Randomness" baseline added to `results_v1.json`/`.md`** (2,000 random re-pairings of the
    system's own scores against the human scores) so "is this real agreement or noise" has an
    empirical answer (actual QWK ≈ 6 SDs above the random-pairing mean) rather than relying on the
    kappa-band interpretation alone.
